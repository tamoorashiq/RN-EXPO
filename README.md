# React Native & Expo Scaffold App

This is a React Native and Expo scaffold app that covers signing in and sending files to a remote API in the background.

## Features

- User authentication with sign-in functionality.
- Background file upload to a remote API.(As there's no API added so it will give error, i-e network error)


Test users
{ name: "user1", email: "user1@gmail.com", password: "password1" },
{ name: "user2", email: "user2@gmail.com", password: "password2" },

validating with these two users as there is no backend.
